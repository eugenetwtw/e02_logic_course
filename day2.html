                    <h2>Argument Structure and Types</h2>
                    <p>An argument consists of a set of statements. Some statements (premises) support another statement (the conclusion). Yesterday we learned how to identify premises and conclusions. Today we'll look deeper into how arguments are organized.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Basic Structure</h3>
                    <p>A complete argument usually contains the following parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Premise: Statements used to support the conclusion, there may be one or more</li>
                        <li>Inference process: The thought process from premises to conclusion</li>
                        <li>Conclusion: The statement that the argument attempts to prove or support</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Types of Arguments</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the form of reasoning, arguments can be divided into two main types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deductive Argument</strong>: If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true</li>
                        <li><strong>Inductive Argument</strong>: If the premises are true, the conclusion may be true, but not necessarily</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                
                <section id="valid-invalid" class="course-section">
                    <h2>Valid and Invalid Arguments</h2>
                    <p>The validity of an argument is an important standard for evaluating its quality.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Valid Argument</h3>
                    <p>A valid argument is one in which, if all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In other words, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example of a valid argument:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        All humans are mortal. (Premise)<br>
                        Socrates is human. (Premise)<br>
                        Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>In this argument, if the premises "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is human" are true, then the conclusion "Socrates is mortal" must also be true.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Invalid Argument</h3>
                    <p>An invalid argument is one where even if all the premises are true, the conclusion could still be false.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example of an invalid argument:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        If it rains, the ground gets wet. (Premise)<br>
                        The ground is wet. (Premise)<br>
                        Therefore, it rained. (Conclusion)
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>In this case, even if the premises are true, the conclusion may still be false because the ground could be wet for other reasons such as sprinklers or a broken pipe.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sound Argument</h3>
                    <p>A sound argument is both valid and has true premises. In other words, a sound argument is a valid argument with all true premises.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example of a sound argument:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        All mammals have lungs. (Premise, true)<br>
                        Whales are mammals. (Premise, true)<br>
                        Therefore, whales have lungs. (Conclusion, true)
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This argument is valid in form and its premises are true, so it is sound.</p>

                    <h2>Deductive and Inductive Reasoning</h2>
                    <p>Deductive and inductive reasoning are two basic forms of inference used in daily life and in scientific research.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Deductive Reasoning</h3>
                    <p>Deductive reasoning moves from general principles to specific cases. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.</p>
                    
                    <p>Characteristics of deductive reasoning:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From general to specific</strong>: Reasoning from general principles to specific cases</li>
                        <li><strong>High certainty of conclusion</strong>: If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true</li>
                        <li><strong>No new information</strong>: Only reveals information already implicit in the premises</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Example of deductive reasoning:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        All metals expand when heated. (General principle)<br>
                        Copper is a metal. (Specific case)<br>
                        Therefore, copper expands when heated. (Conclusion)
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <h3>Inductive Reasoning</h3>
                    <p>Inductive reasoning moves from specific cases to general principles. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion is only probably true.</p>
                    
                    <p>Characteristics of inductive reasoning:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From specific to general</strong>: Reasoning from specific cases to general principles</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower certainty of conclusion</strong>: Even if the premises are true, the conclusion may not be true</li>
                        <li><strong>Adds new information</strong>: Goes beyond the information contained in the premises</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Example of inductive reasoning:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Every crow we have observed is black. (Specific case)<br>
                        Therefore, all crows are black. (General principle)
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>In this example, even though all observed crows are black, we cannot be certain that every crow is black because we have not seen them all.</p>

                <section id="fallacies" class="course-section">
                    <h2>Common Logical Fallacies</h2>
                    <p>A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that renders an argument invalid or unsound. Knowing common fallacies helps us recognize and avoid these mistakes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ad Hominem</h3>
                    <p>The ad hominem fallacy attacks the person making an argument rather than the argument itself.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        John says we should exercise more, but he rarely does, so his suggestion isn't worth listening to.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This is fallacious because John's personal habits have nothing to do with whether his advice is sound.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Appeal to Authority</h3>
                    <p>The appeal to authority fallacy assumes a claim is true simply because an authority figure says so.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        A famous actor says this diet pill works, so it must work.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This is fallacious because the actor is not a medical expert and lacks authority on the subject.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Straw Man Fallacy</h3>
                    <p>The straw man fallacy distorts an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Alice: I think the school should offer more sports options.<br>
                        Bob: How can you say studying isn't important? We're here to learn, not to play.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This is fallacious because Bob misrepresents Alice's point. She never said studying wasn't important.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Slippery Slope</h3>
                    <p>The slippery slope fallacy claims that taking one step will inevitably trigger a chain of uncontrollable events leading to disaster.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        If students can use phones in class, they'll play all day, stop learning, and eventually fail.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This is fallacious because allowing phones doesn't necessarily mean students will play all day or fail.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Appeal to Emotion</h3>
                    <p>The appeal to emotion fallacy attempts to persuade by arousing feelings rather than providing logical reasons.</p>
                    
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        You don't support this policy? Don't you care about people who need help?
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This is fallacious because it tries to induce guilt instead of presenting sound reasons.</p>

                        <li><strong>Curiosity</strong>: Maintaining curiosity about the nature and causes of things</li>
                        <li><strong>Skepticism</strong>: Not easily accepting unverified claims</li>
                        <li><strong>Humility</strong>: Acknowledging the limitations of one's knowledge and understanding</li>
                        <li><strong>Systematicity</strong>: Thinking about problems in an organized way</li>
